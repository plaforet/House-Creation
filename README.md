# House-Creation

## Overview
I wrote this to randomly generate the student lists for a House system for our school, similar to the houses in Harry Potter or the [Tribes Learning Community](https://tribes.com/) student management system. Any student names or IDs are fictional and only used for testing.

## First Version
The first version of this project adds students from a text file to a master ArrayList, then randomly adds them to one of four house specific ArrayLists, which I printed to console and copied into a new text file.

## Current Version
I've been working on reading from and outputting to a CSV file instead. This is my first foray in workign with CSV files and using FileWriter, so bear with me. If you have any suggestions to make this code better, I'm open to constructive criticism!
