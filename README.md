# House-Creation

## Overview
I wrote this to randomly generate the student lists for a House system for our school, similar to the houses in Harry Potter or the [Tribes Learning Community](https://tribes.com/) student management system. Any student names or IDs are fictional and only used for testing.

## First Version
The first version of this project adds students from a text file to a master ArrayList, then randomly adds them to one of four house specific ArrayLists, which I printed to console and copied into a new text file.

## Current Plans
I'm currently working on outputting to a CSV file instead. This is my first foray into outputting to CSV, so bear with me.
